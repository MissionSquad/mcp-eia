# Main Technology Choices

This document outlines the key technologies chosen for this MCP Server Template and the rationale behind them.

## Node.js (v20+)

-   **Choice:** Use Node.js as the runtime environment.
-   **Rationale:**
    *   Excellent performance for I/O-bound operations common in web servers and API interactions.
    *   Large and active ecosystem (npm) providing numerous libraries.
    *   JavaScript/TypeScript allows for full-stack development with a single language (if applicable).
    *   Asynchronous, non-blocking nature fits well with handling concurrent MCP requests.
-   **Alternatives:** Python (Django/Flask), Go, Java (Spring), Ruby (Rails).
-   **Decision Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## TypeScript (v5.5+)

-   **Choice:** Use TypeScript as the primary programming language.
-   **Rationale:**
    *   Static typing improves code quality, maintainability, and reduces runtime errors.
    *   Enhanced developer experience through better tooling (autocompletion, refactoring).
    *   Superset of JavaScript, allowing gradual adoption and use of existing JS libraries.
    *   Aligns with modern backend development practices.
-   **Alternatives:** Plain JavaScript (ES6+).
-   **Decision Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## @missionsquad/fastmcp

-   **Choice:** Use the FastMCP library for MCP server implementation.
-   **Rationale:**
    *   Specifically designed for building MCP servers, simplifying protocol handling.
    *   Provides clear abstractions for defining tools and handling requests/responses.
    *   Includes features like `extraArgs` crucial for the template's multi-user authentication strategy.
-   **Alternatives:** Implementing the MCP protocol manually, using other potential (less common) MCP libraries.
-   **Decision Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Zod

-   **Choice:** Use Zod for schema definition and validation.
-   **Rationale:**
    *   Excellent TypeScript integration, providing static type inference from schemas.
    *   Fluent and expressive API for defining complex validation rules.
    *   Used by FastMCP for tool parameter validation, making it a natural fit.
    *   Also used for validating environment configuration (`src/config.ts`).
-   **Alternatives:** Joi, Yup, io-ts, manual validation.
-   **Decision Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Dotenv

-   **Choice:** Use `dotenv` for loading environment variables from `.env` files.
-   **Rationale:**
    *   Standard practice for managing environment-specific configuration during development.
    *   Simple and widely adopted.
-   **Alternatives:** Manual environment variable management, platform-specific configuration services (e.g., AWS Parameter Store - could be used *in addition*).
-   **Decision Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## UUID

-   **Choice:** Use the `uuid` library for generating unique identifiers.
-   **Rationale:**
    *   Needed by the `ResourceManager` to assign unique IDs to resource instances for logging and tracking.
    *   Standard and reliable way to generate UUIDs.
-   **Alternatives:** Using Node.js `crypto.randomUUID()` (available in newer Node versions), custom ID generation schemes.
-   **Decision Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
