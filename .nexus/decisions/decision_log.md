# Decision Log

## YYYY-MM-DD - Initial Template Design Choices

-   **Context:** Need for a reusable, scalable, and multi-user capable MCP server template.
-   **Decision:** Adopted Node.js, TypeScript, and FastMCP as the core stack. Implemented a specific token handling strategy using `extraArgs` with environment variable fallback. Included a generic `ResourceManager` for efficient handling of external service clients/connections.
-   **Rationale:**
    *   Node.js/TypeScript: Modern, efficient, good ecosystem for backend development.
    *   FastMCP: Simplifies MCP implementation.
    *   Token Handling Strategy: Provides security and flexibility for multi-user scenarios while retaining compatibility with single-user deployments. Addresses the need to hide sensitive credentials from tool schemas.
    *   ResourceManager: Promotes efficiency and prevents resource exhaustion by caching and cleaning up external connections/clients.
-   **Alternatives Considered:**
    *   Simpler template without multi-user auth or resource management (less scalable/flexible).
    *   Including auth tokens directly in tool schemas (less secure).
    *   Using different libraries for MCP or configuration.
-   **Consequences:** Requires developers using the template to understand the specific token handling and resource management patterns. Adds slight complexity compared to a minimal server.
